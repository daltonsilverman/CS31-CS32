In step 5 of this program, there is no checks that the amount of voters for each politician add up to the total number of voters answered in the first prompt. In my example, I initially said that 20 people 
were survryed, and that 40 people voted for Gavin and -2 people voted for Brian. I therefore got the nonsensical output "200.0% say they will vote for Gavin. -10.0% say they will vote for Brian. Gavin is 
predicted to win the election. The percentages calculated are obviously nonsensical as a negative percentage nor a percentage greater than 100% could exist in this context.

In step 6, I switched the statement:  if (forGavin > forBrian) to: if (forGavin < forBrian). This resulted in the final results of the outcome to be switched in the output, as in if Gavin had more votes, 
Brian was declared the winner, and vice versa.

In step 7, I removed a semicolon from line 16, the statement: cout << "How many of them will vote for Gavin? ". In g++, I was told that a ; was expected before the start of the next line which I was notified 
began was 'cin' and in xcode I was simply told that ; was expected at the end of the expression. The other error I made was I removed the top statement: #include <iostream>. In both compilers this removed the 
notification about the missing semicolon. In xcode, I was told for every instance of cout, cin, ios, and endl that they were the use of an undeclared identifier. I was also given a warning for my line: using 
namespace std; that "Using namespace refers to implicitly-defined namespace 'std'. In g++ I was given the same messages about cout, cin, ios, and endl being undeclared in this scope, and was given the 
recommendation that they were included in the header <iostream> and to add the line "#include <iostream>"
