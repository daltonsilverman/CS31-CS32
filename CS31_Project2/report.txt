The main obstacle I had while trying to complete this project was trying 
to figure out how I wanted the control flow to work involving the clause 
of nurses and teachers receiving a different tax rate. I also had trouble 
initially figuring out how I wanted to tax different portions of the 
income by different amounts. I settled on creating a system in which 
income was checked at the end of each specific tax bracket. I knew if the 
income was greater than the bracket in its entirety, the amount added to 
the total tax would be constant. If it was not greater than the threshold 
of the bracket, I knew there would be no income entering the next tax 
bracket and could tax the remaining income by the tax rate of that bracket.

Test Data:
Working name, income within first tax bracket, non-nurse/teacher, 0 
children(Dalton Silverman, 30000, bartender, 0)

Working name, income within second tax bracket, non-nurse/teacher, 0 
children(Dalton Silverman, 100000, plumber, 0)

Working name, income within second tax bracket, nurse, 0 children (Dalton 
Silverman, 100000, nurse, 0)

Working name, income within second tax bracket, teacher, 0 children, 
checking to see both "teacher" and "nurse" activate new tax calculation 
(Dalton Silverman, 100000, teacher, 0)

Working name, income beyond 125000, non-nurse/teacher, 0 children (Dalton 
Silverman, 180000, engineer, 0) - Did not work at first but resolved

Debug case - income at exactly 125000 to help figure out calculation 
issues at the time (Dalton Silverman, 125000, engineer, 0)

Working name, income beyond 125000, nurse (do not have to test for teacher 
as have previously found out both work together), 0 children (Dalton 
Silverman, 130000, nurse, 0)

Testing with children and income > 125000 (Dalton Silverman, 150000, 
engineer, 2)

Testing with children and income < 125000 (Dalton Silverman, 60000, 
farmer, 3)

Testing with children benefit causing tax to go down to the negatives and 
return to 0 (Dalton Silverman, 20000, bartender, 10)

Testing name with empty string ("", input stops)

Testing with negative income(Dalton Silverman, -1000, input stops)

Testing with empty string occupation (Dalton Silverman, 20000, "", input 
stops)

Testing with negative children (Dalton Silverman, 20000, bartender, -4)

Testing with input greater than 2 decimal places (Dalton Silverman, 45343.34235, doctor, 3)
